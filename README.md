# Networks - Project 1

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a website as part of a Computer Networking project. The website is created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, and is deployed on Vercel.

## Domain & Hosting

The website is hosted on Vercel and is accessible via the subdomain [networks-project-1.vercel.app](https://networks-project-1.vercel.app). Vercel provides a seamless deployment process with CI/CD integration.

## Website Setup

The website is built using Next.js for the framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for type safety. The repository is hosted on GitHub, and any push or merge to the main branch triggers a deployment on Vercel.

## Networking Aspects

The site is accessible online, demonstrating knowledge of DNS, IP addresses, and protocols. The domain name system (DNS) translates the domain name to an IP address, allowing users to access the site via the subdomain.

## Challenges Faced

Some challenges faced during the project included configuring the DNS settings and ensuring the CI/CD pipeline was correctly set up. These were resolved by referring to Vercel and GitHub documentation.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with web development and networking concepts. The website is live and demonstrates the application of DNS, IP addresses, and deployment protocols.
